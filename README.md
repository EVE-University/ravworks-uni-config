## EVE University - Ravworks configs

You can download these files and upload them to Ravworks to get configuration of all the structures in PC9 pocket. There are three files, you only need one. The difference between them is only the invention skill levels (all at either level 3, 4 or 5)

Structures configuration is based on the Consolidated forum post of NSC structures (https://forum.eveuniversity.org/viewtopic.php?p=956643#p956643)

You are more then welcome to post changes and fix errors in the config file. Please fork this repo, make changes to your fork and request a merge to the UNI repo.
